A tool-kit to add desired features to Excel. Example: zoom in on a chart with mouse

I am quite simple-minded, so all files achieve a very specific task and are commented heavily. If there is no ReadMe, then it is highly recommended that on reads the comments at the beginning of the file.

I am not good enough of a programmer to make tools which work by downloading them to some subfolder in your file system. Each tool is either "wrapped up" in one file or one folder and the instructions should be clear enough so that knowing how to use the tool takes less time than re-creating the tool. If you get "stuck", I try to write my code in a very verbose way so that literally re-typing it all is not the worst; the verboseness means more typing, but you are quite likely to understand what you are typing as you are typing it.
